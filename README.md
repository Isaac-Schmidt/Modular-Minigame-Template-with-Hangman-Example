# Modular-Minigame-Template-with-Hangman-Example
### This is just an example template for a simple java text mini-game collection.
### To use with an IDE such as IntelliJ, place these files into the src folder of a project. 
### If you are not using an IDE you will need to compile them before using. See google on how to do compile on a cmd/terminal.
